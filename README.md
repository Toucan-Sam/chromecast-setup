# Chromecast AdBlocking
It's not perfect because I don't watch regular TV but my solution is this...

Look for a TV with the screen/panel you like. Ignore all of the smart features. When you find the one you like, confirm it supports CEC, which is device control over HDMI. Most major brands support it.

Don't bother connecting it to the internet. Buy a Chromecast with Google TV.

Make sure the CEC control is on, I believe on LG it's off by default.

As you set up the Chromecast it'll walk you through controlling your TV with the Chromecast remote. Put the TV remote away forever. Yes, even turning on and off the TV.

On the Chromecast, install FLauncher and use Launcher Manager to set it as default.

With Launcher Manager there are two versions, one for Fire Stick and one for Android TV. You'll need the one for Android TV. I installed TV Bro as a web browser to do this and you'll need to allow it to install applications in the security settings.

FLauncher is a bit clunky to set up groups, but you can hide apps you don't want with a bit of fiddling and then it never changes. Enable Unsplash in FLauncher for pretty backgrounds.

Voil√†. No ads, only the apps you want, and a simple remote. Plus, it works with almost any new television.

Does Google still do analytics? Sure, but it's at least one less vendor in the mix.

Bonus tip #1: If you log the Chromecast into a Google account, you can log into the same account on your computer and install FLauncher, TV Bro, Netflix, etc remotely which is much easier than searching for things on the TV.

Bonus tip #2: Sign up a random email address and use it on your TV. It'll make it easier to manage apps and if the TV is shared you don't have to worry about your own data being available to other users. Example; a shared flat. This doesn't stop you signing into or impact your usage/experience with Netflix, Disney+, or other apps.

Bonus tip #3: If you have YouTube Premium/RED, just add your TV account as a family account to get rid of the ads.

Bonus tip #4: Anyone in the house can still cast as usual on their own accounts from their phones.

Bonus tip #5: Take the Chromecast with you on trips if you have kids or plan to chill out in the hotel. As long as you connect it to WiFi you have everything already set up. You might just have to turn the TV on and adjust volume with that device's remote.
